# Research-Paper-Summarization

Reading research papers takes up a big chunk of an applied data scientist's time.
Using this WebApp you can just copy-paste/ upload the research paper and get a gist within 15 seconds to decide if it is even relevant/ worth reading for your use case.

## Results
Input: [Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) (The Research paper which introduced Dropout) <br> <br>
Output(Summary): "Dropout is a technique to randomly drop units from the neural network during training. Dropout improves the performance of neural networks by adding noise to its hidden units. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. The idea of dropping out is not limited to feed-forward neural networks."

### To Do
- [ ] Deploy as a WebApp.
- [ ] Retrain on the [Scisumm](https://cs.stanford.edu/~myasu/projects/scisumm_net/) dataset to improve performance.
